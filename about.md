I'm a rising junior studying artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon 
University. 
My current interests lie mostly in the realm of natural language processing, 
but I'm always open to expanding my knowledge in other fields.

University of Minnesota Talented Youth Math Program (abbreviated UMTYMP):
The collegiate component consisted of the courses 
_MATH 1471_, 
_MATH 1472_, 
_MATH 1473_, 
_MATH 2471_, 
_MATH 2472_, and
_MATH 2473_, 
covering single and multivariable calculus and linear algebra.
I took these courses from 2014 to 2017, spanning 8th through 10th grade of
high school.
