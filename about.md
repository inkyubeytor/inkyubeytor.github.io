I'm a rising junior studying artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon 
University. My current interests lie mostly in the realm of natural language 
processing, but I'm always open to expanding my knowledge in other fields.

If you're looking for my one-page resume,
[look no further]({{ site.url }}/files/resume-2021-05-25.pdf). A more detailed 
description of my experience is below.


# Work Experience

### Data Science Intern at Verizon - Systems Performance Engineering

### Teaching Assistant for 15-150: Principles of Functional Programming

# Research Experience

### Verdant: Computational Notebook Versioning

As part of the 2020 CMU HCII REU program, I worked on the JupyterLab extension
Verdant, which provides advanced version control features for experiments run
in computational notebooks, including cell-level versioning, output diffing,
and intelligent search.

I worked on development of the core extension with React, Redux, and 
TypeScript. I also developed a chart classification pipeline using scikit-learn
to differentiate different types of chart output images from other images.

# Projects

### LU-Partition

### QA-QG System

Our Natural Language Processing semester project was a question-answering and
question generation system. Given a set of Wikipedia articles, it can either
generate factoid questions about the text or answer given questions. Our 
project won the position for best question generation.

This project was built primarily with spaCy and NLTK, with some components such
as BERT models from huggingface.

### Recipe Delta

Recipe Delta was a HackCMU 2019 project. We created a web application that 
allows you to easily find recipes oriented towards using up ingredients you 
have on hand.

Our frontend was built with AngularJS and our backend was built with Python.

### EduPass

I worked on this project from my freshman through junior years of high school, 
first as part of the JA Company program and then as part of an independent 
startup.

We created an educational technology product to solve the problem of tracking 
school attendance during flexible schedule offerings (i.e. periods in which 
students were free to choose what classes or extracurricular offerings they
participated in). Our tool allowed students to search offerings and coordinate 
with friends, teachers to invite students and track classroom attendance, and 
administrators to view individual to school-level analytics across multiple
sessions.

I held a variety of positions throughout my time with EduPass, including 
frontend developer (in AngularJS), backend developer (LAMP stack with Python 
and Flask), and CTO (managing product direction and coordinating adoption of
Agile management strategies).
