I'm a rising junior studying artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon 
University. My current interests lie mostly in the realm of natural language 
processing, but I'm always open to expanding my knowledge in other fields.

If you're looking for my one-page resume,
[look no further]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/resume-2021-05-25.pdf). 
A more detailed description of my experience is below.


# Work Experience

### Data Science Intern at Verizon - Systems Performance Engineering

I worked with systems performance data to analyze and optimize network 
parameters affecting dropped call KPIs. I developed pipelines to automate 
data aggregation and trained a variety of machine learning models including
XGBoost ensembles to select optimal parameter values for network configuration.

### Teaching Assistant for 15-150: Principles of Functional Programming

As a teaching assistant, I co-taught a lab/recitation section with over 20
students. developed new content for homework assignments. helped over 100 
students at office hours, and graded assignments and exams.

### Grader for Art of Problem Solving

As a grader, I provided personalized feedback to student problem submissions 
for Python and algebra problems.

# Research Experience

### Verdant: Computational Notebook Versioning

As part of the 2020 CMU HCII REU program, I worked on the JupyterLab extension
[Verdant](https://github.com/mkery/Verdant), which provides advanced version 
control features for experiments run in computational notebooks, including 
cell-level versioning, output diffing, and intelligent search.

I worked on development of the core extension with React, Redux, and 
TypeScript. I also developed a 
[chart classification](https://github.com/inkyubeytor/chart_classification)
pipeline using scikit-learn to differentiate different types of chart output 
images from other images.


### AI-Assisted User Research Tools

As part of a CMU HCII independent study, I developed a Python 
[tool](https://github.com/inkyubeytor/ai_ux_tools) for automatically 
summarizing research interview data and performing comparisons between textual 
data to find outliers. I also performed a landscape analysis of current methods 
in abstractive and extractive text summarization.

### Architecture and Analysis for High-Assurance Autonomy

I worked on a project to improve training and testing methods for computer
vision neural networks, using self-driving planes as the problem domain.
I coauthored [a paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8718224) on input 
prioritization methods for lowering the human cost of labeling collected data.
I coauthored [another paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9176830) on 
generating synthetic test data using variational autoencoders. I also wrote 
interfaces for and automated data collection in the X-Plane 11 simulator.

# Projects

### LU-Partition

We [implemented](https://github.com/inkyubeytor/lupartition) the LU-partition 
algorithm from 
[this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00453-010-9485-y)
as part of a project with the Princeton Gerrymandering Project's Ensemble Club.
The algorithm will be used in algorithmic drawing of district maps, with the
goal of improving map analysis through direct sampling of the map distribution. 

### QA-QG System

Our Natural Language Processing semester project was a question-answering and
question generation system. Given a set of Wikipedia articles, it can either
generate factoid questions about the text or answer given questions. Our 
project won the position for best question generation.

This project was built primarily with spaCy and NLTK, with some components such
as BERT models from Hugging Face.

### Recipe Delta

Recipe Delta was a HackCMU 2019 project. We created a web application that 
allows you to easily find recipes oriented towards using up ingredients you 
have on hand.

Our [frontend](https://github.com/inkyubeytor/recipe_delta-client) was built 
with AngularJS and our 
[backend](https://github.com/inkyubeytor/recipe_delta-server) was built with 
Python.

### EduPass

I worked on this project from my freshman through junior years of high school, 
first as part of the JA Company program and then as part of an independent 
startup.

We created an educational technology product to solve the problem of tracking 
school attendance during flexible schedule offerings (i.e. periods in which 
students were free to choose what classes or extracurricular offerings they
participated in). Our tool allowed students to search offerings and coordinate 
with friends, teachers to invite students and track classroom attendance, and 
administrators to view individual to school-level analytics across multiple
sessions.

I held a variety of positions throughout my time with EduPass, including 
frontend developer (in AngularJS), backend developer (LAMP stack with Python 
and Flask), and CTO (managing product direction and coordinating adoption of
Agile management strategies).
